## Dashboard Overview

![Saudi Airlines Dashboard](pic1.png)

**Main Features:**
- Annual passenger volume trends (2016â€“2023)
- Flight counts by airport and flight type (Domestic vs. International)
- Passenger distribution by airline (Saudia, Flynas, Flyadeal)
- Flight distribution by airline
- Filters by airport, airline, and flight type
- Reset button for default dashboard state

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following fields:
- Airline name
- Domestic and international passenger counts
- Total passenger count
- Number of flights
- Flight type
- Airport name
- Year of operation

---

## Data Preparation & Processing

**Steps performed:**
1. Cleaned raw data in Excel (null values, types)
2. Created calculated columns (e.g., total passengers, share per airline)
3. Conducted time-series trend analysis
4. Built interactive visualizations in Power BI:
   - Line chart for passenger trends
   - Bar charts and pie charts for airline/airport stats
   - Card visuals for key figures (total passengers, flights, peak year)
   - Slicers + reset button for interactivity

## Key Findings

- Over **416 million passengers** traveled during the analysis period
- Around **3 million flights** were executed
- **2016** had the lowest passenger traffic (potential for improvement)
- Passenger load was nearly equally distributed across **Saudia, Flynas, and Flyadeal**
- ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦ Domestic and international flights were roughly **50/50**

---

## Recommendations

- Improve airline coordination to avoid over-saturation
- Expand infrastructure at high-traffic airports (e.g., Riyadh, Jeddah)
- Use predictive analytics to optimize seasonal capacity
- Enhance operational efficiency in years with low passenger volume
